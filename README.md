For this assignment I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

- The ticker symbol.

- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock.

- The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
